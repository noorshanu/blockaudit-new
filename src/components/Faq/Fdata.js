        question: 'How long does the audit process typically take?',
        answer:'The length of time required to complete a smart contract audit can vary based on factors such as the complexity of the contract and the scope of the project. Typically, an audit can take several days to several weeks, and clear communication with the project team can help to ensure an efficient and effective audit process. An experienced audit firm should be able to provide an estimated timeline based on the project needs.'
